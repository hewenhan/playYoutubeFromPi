# playYoutubeFromPi
It is well known that the media capabilities of Raspberry Pi are decent, but due to the limitations of the browser, playing videos from platforms like YouTube at 1080p resolution can be quite choppy. Therefore, I want to write a program to stream YouTube videos' traffic to a local player for playback. Would this eliminate the choppiness?

## Useage:
```bash
./ytplayer.py <youtube_url>
```
